title: (MIGRATED) ThoughtWorks Interview Experience!
---

ThoughtWorks came in my college around end July. Their interviews are quite famous for being very open ended and covering vast topics. So here is my experience of the whole recruitment process. 

There were  rounds:
- A coding round
- A OA round with MCQs and Coding
- A Code pairing Round
- A Technical Interview round
- Cultural Fit Round

### Coding Round

This was the first round that was conducted as a part of the interview process. The question were mainly easy - medium leetcode level. For me I got a question on Binary Search and another question was on pattern and maths. It was a 30 minute test on Hackerrank. The trick was to finish the questions in the given time correctly. The difficulty of the questions varied and some of my friends got tougher questions. 


### OA Round

Two days after the results of the Coding round were declared, the OA was scheduled. This was a test on HackerEarth and consisted of 10 MCQ Questons on DSA,and OOPs. The questions were mainly based on OOPs and one had to use concepts of OOP Principles to solve them. The coding questions again were easy-medium Leetcode questions. 


### Code Pairing Round

This round was a completely new type of interview round unlike anything I had previously experienced. We were put into 1 on 1 zoom call with a pair and were asked to solve a problem. The question that was asked to me was to create a CUI application that takes the input for a doctor's weekly schedule and patient appointment requests and then lets the inquiring patient know if their appointment can be made or not. More than having a correct working code, my interviewer focussed more on the logic I was using to solve this and the algorithm I used. This round went on for about 2 hours and it was a really fun and interesting round. The interviewer also stressed a lot on clean code practises and OOPs principles that I used and why I used them. Although I was not able to show a fully working code in the given time frame, my interviewer was satisfied with my solution and felt that the algorithm I used was well optimised enough to pass the test. 


### Technical Interview Round

This was the round I was worried about the most since this round is supposed to be the round where most people are eliminated. I was greeted by two ThoughtWorkers who very quickly started asking me questions on a variety of topics. We began with my projects. They asked me discuss about any of the most recent projects that I did. I told them about an Android app I worked on and a Django web application I had made few months back. When I told them that the web app was deployed and I could show them, they became interested in it. It was an app to track expenses called Expensius. It had basic user authentication and a dashboard where users could create multiple accounts and record and track their expenses and figure out how much money they are spending on a monthly basis. I explained the backend of the app. The way I have used the Django ORM, the queries I had written. They asked me in detail about the database structure that I had made. Any improvements that I could have done if I was to make the same project again. We also discussed about some specific scenarios and they asked me about how I have handled them. To judge my knowledge of DBMS, they asked me to write some queries on the same database structure that I had used in the application. This discussion lasted for over 35 minutes. When it was over, we moved on to OS. Here they asked me some basic questions on threads, race conditions. After this we moved on to Networking and they asked me some practical networking problems. Like how we can set custom domains for the localhost ip and so on. Once they were satisfied with it, we moved on to DSA. Here they asked me some abstract questions on DS like Maps. How hashmaps work and how we can use hashmaps to increase efficiency of data retrieval from complex data structure. The questions were interesting and simple enough that anyone with proper understanding of the usage of the DS can answer them. After the DSA section, the interview came to an emd. It lasted for over 1 hour 50 minutes. 


### Cultural Fit Round

This round was conducted by some senior members of the team who just had a nice chat with me to figure out what sort of a person I was. We spoke on various topics like gender equality, discrimation and social change. We also spoke about conflict resolution and teamwork. They asked me give examples of conflict resolution from my experience and they asked me about my interests and likes. Overall we spoke for around 1 hour and had a nice interesting chat. 


### Final Result and Impression

After about 12 hours after the cultural fit round, I got the result that I was selected and was offered the Role of Application Developer. The whole interview process was very smooth and interesting. The interviewers were very chilled and knowledgeable. They made sure to give proper explainations to questions I could not answer and made sure I understood them. It felt like I learnt a lot from the interview themselves. I also liked the fact that the interview lets you show what you are good at. If your forte is competitive coding, the interviews are more coding focussed. However if you have done a lot of projects, they let you showcase that. Overall it was a great and fun experience!
