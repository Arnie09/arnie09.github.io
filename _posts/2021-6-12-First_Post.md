title: Welcome to yet another change in the blog!
---


Welcome to this blog. I have decomissioned the blog that I had on Heroku and have decided to go with this blog made using Jekyll and github pages.
There were several reasons why I choose to go by this approach:

* The website I had made in heroku using backend stack was a overkill for the number of people visiting the blog. Most of the features were not used. 
* I had trouble adding new posts and logging in every time when github pages had this simple solution of posting from commit messages. 
* Using this method doesnot keep the blog formats limited to one style or layout I can add whatever I like whenever I like. 
* PERFORMANCE. Static served pages without database connections are freaking fast and load up within seconds.
* The whole process of blog posting became a whole lot easy and fast using this method and I get to use my favourite editor to write blogs. (Hopefully this makes me post more blogs)
* I can host the images and other assets on github itself. I dont have to rely on a third party library to fetch my images. 
* Editing and customising the website is easier in this way. 

Thanks for reading. I will migrate my old blogs from heroku slowly and add customize this website slowly.
