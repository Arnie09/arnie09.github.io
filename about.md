Hey visitor. My name is Arnab Chanda. Welcome to my portfolio/blog. I am a CS Engineering graduate currently working as an Application Developer at ThoughtWorks. 


### Professional Experience:

* I am currently working as an Application Developer at [ThoughtWorks](https://www.thoughtworks.com). In current project, I am working as full stack developer working for a medical company. Project stack is .Net Core, React and Azure.
* Before joining as a Developer, I was an Application Developer Intern at [ThoughtWorks](https://www.thoughtworks.com) where I worked on a big data project. The stack was Spark, Scala and Python. 
* I also had a brief experience working at [HackerEarth](https://www.hackerearth.com) where I worked as a Backend Engineering Intern and worked on the plagiarism feature of the platform. 
* During my third semester of college, I also worked at [Eriyaaz](https://www.eriyaz.com) where I worked as an Android Developer Intern and worked on a host of small features and revamped their chatting backend. 
* Other than these I also work on Freelance projects. I mostly work full stack on the Django-html-css-js stack and native Android on the mobile end.
  

### Some of my interests include:
