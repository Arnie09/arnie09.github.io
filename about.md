Hey visitor. My name is Arnab Chanda. Welcome to my portfolio/blog. I am a CS Engineering graduate currently in the course's last semester. 

* I am currently an Application Developer Intern at [ThoughtWorks](https://www.thoughtworks.com) where I will be joining as a full time Application Developer post my degree completion. In ThoughtWorks I am currently working on a big data project which is on a stack of Spark, Scala and Python
* I also had a brief experience working at [HackerEarth](https://www.hackerearth.com) where I worked as a Backend Engineering Intern and worked on the plagiarism feature of the platform. 
* During my third semester of college, I also worked at [Eriyaaz](https://www.eriyaz.com) where I worked as an Android Developer Intern and worked on a host of small features and revamped their chatting backend. 
* Other than these I also work on Freelance projects. I mostly work full stack on the Django-html-css-js stack and native Android on the mobile end.
  


### Some of my interests include: 

* Watching Movies. I watch a lot of movies and hopefully I will review some of them in these blog. I also watch TV series but not as much as I watch movies. 
* Photography. I like to click pictures and I post some of them on my [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/arnaaabbb)
* Coding. I like to solve problems on Algorithms and problems on Data Structures. I am most active now on [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/pumpkin_dumplin/)
* Gaming. I like to play PC games mostly online multiplayer FPS shooters.
